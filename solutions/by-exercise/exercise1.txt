Exercise 1:

Question: 

Explain the purpose of unit tests in the context of the addBook and 
removeBook functions in bookManager.js. 

How do unit tests fit into the software development lifecycle for this module?


Answer:

Unit tests verify that individual functions like addBook and removeBook work 
correctly by testing them in isolation. 

They help catch bugs early, ensure code reliability, and 
facilitate maintenance. 

In the software development lifecycle, unit tests are written during 
development to validate each function's behavior, contributing to 
continuous integration and delivery.
