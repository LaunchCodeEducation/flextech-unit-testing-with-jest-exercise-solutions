Exercise 20:

Question: 

Configure Jest to collect coverage only from bookManager.js and 
exclude other files or directories.



Answer:

Update jest.config.js:

```
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  collectCoverageFrom: ['bookManager.js'],
};
```

Now, when running tests with coverage, 
Jest will only collect coverage data from bookManager.js.
