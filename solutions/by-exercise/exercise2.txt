Exercise 2:

Question: 

Describe the differences between manual testing and automated unit testing for 
the findBooksByAuthor function. 

What are the benefits of using automated tests in this case?

Answer:

Manual testing involves a human executing the function and verifying the 
output, which is time-consuming and error-prone. 

Automated unit testing uses scripts to run tests automatically, providing 
quick and consistent feedback. 

For findBooksByAuthor, automated tests can efficiently test multiple scenarios, 
ensuring the function works correctly without manual intervention.
