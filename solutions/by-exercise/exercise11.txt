Exercise 11:

Question: 

Explain the differences between strict and loose equality checks in Jest, 
and demonstrate with examples using toBe, toEqual, and 
toStrictEqual for objects.


Answer:

toBe checks for strict identity (===), meaning both references point to 
the same object.

toEqual checks for deep equality, matching values recursively.

toStrictEqual is like toEqual but checks for undefined properties and 
object types.
