Exercise 17:


Question: 

Collect coverage statistics using Jest and configure thresholds to 
enforce code quality. 

Set a threshold of 90% for statements, functions, and lines, and 
80% for branches in jest.config.js.



Answer:

Update jest.config.js:

```
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      statements: 90,
      branches: 80,
      functions: 90,
      lines: 90,
    },
  },
};
```

Now, when running tests with coverage, Jest will enforce these thresholds:

`npm test -- --coverage`


If the coverage falls below these thresholds, Jest will report an error.
