### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Unit Testing Fundamentals**:
    
    - The purpose of unit tests and how they fit into the software development lifecycle.
    - Differences between manual testing and automated unit testing.
    - Test-driven development (TDD) and the benefits of writing unit tests first.
2. **Jest Basics**:
    
    - Installing Jest and setting it up for a project using npm.
    - Writing simple unit tests using Jest's `test` and `expect` functions.
    - Understanding matchers and how to use them for various types of assertions.
    - Running Jest tests using the command line and configuring Jest with a configuration file.
3. **Test File Organization**:
    
    - Structuring test files using `describe` blocks to group related tests.
    - Using hooks (`beforeAll`, `afterAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`) to perform setup and teardown tasks.
4. **Common Matchers in Jest**:
    
    - Using matchers like `toBe`, `toEqual`, `toStrictEqual`, `toContain`, `toMatch`, `toBeTruthy`, `toBeFalsy`, and `toThrow`.
    - Differences between strict and loose equality checks in Jest.
5. **Mocking and Spying**:
    
    - Creating mock functions to isolate tests and avoid dependencies on external services.
    - Using Jest's automock feature to automatically mock modules.
    - Writing manual mocks to customize the behavior of mocked functions.
    - Using spies to monitor calls to functions and assert they were called correctly.
6. **Testing Asynchronous Code**:
    
    - Writing tests for asynchronous functions using Promises, async/await, and callbacks.
    - Using Jest's `resolves` and `rejects` for testing promise-based code.
    - Ensuring tests wait for asynchronous code to complete using Jest's `done` callback.
7. **Code Coverage**:
    
    - Measuring code coverage and understanding metrics like statement, branch, function, and line coverage.
    - Collecting coverage statistics using Jest and configuring thresholds to enforce code quality.
